# Uni-Ariel-OOP-Ex2

### About the project
In this assignment we were given a json file and had using it, to implement a Directed weighted graph using the given Interfaces.<br/>
In Addition we were given a list of algorithms that we had to implement and then showcase all of it using GUI

### Our Idea
We implmented the directive weighted graph using 2 hashmaps,<br/>
the first is a hashmaps of all the nodes in the graph,<br/>
the second is a hashmaps of all the edges in the graph.<br/>
<br/The nodes were implemented using id's and a hashmap of all the edges going out from this node<br/>
The algorithem we implemented using DFSs and Dijstra


### Files 

| Algoritms    | Describiton | Implent
| ---------- | --------- |
| isConnected | Return true if the graph is connected |
| 999999999  | 999999999  |
| 99999999   | 99999999   |
| 9999999    | 9999999    |
